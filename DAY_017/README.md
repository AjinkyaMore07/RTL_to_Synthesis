# 1-bit comparator

A 2-bit comparator is a digital logic circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers and determines their relationshipâ€”whether one is greater than, equal to, or less than the other.


## ðŸ§  Purpose of a Comparator:
   
    A 1-bit comparator compares A and B and outputs:
    
    A > B
    
    A = B
    
    A < B
